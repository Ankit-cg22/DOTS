/* why do we need a middle ware*/
/* when we delete or like try to edit something we need to check certain things */
/* we need to check who created this post , and is he the same guy who is signed in right now an trying to cause these actions */
/* also while liking we check if this person has already liked a post , cause we allow liking only once */

// All of this is handled by MIDDLEWARE
